# sellCar 🚗

CarSell is a full-stack web application where users can submit their used car details to sell them easily online. It features a clean, responsive UI and integrates with MongoDB and an email service to notify about new submissions.

---

## 📌 Overview

The CarSell platform provides an intuitive multi-step form for users to enter their car information — such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, location, and contact details. Submitted data is saved in a MongoDB database and also triggers an email notification via EmailJS. The app is designed using modern UI practices and deployed seamlessly on Vercel.
